# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my **Machine Learning Internship** with **Elevvo Pathways**.  
The tasks explore regression, clustering, classification, and recommendation systems using real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. [Student Score Prediction](./Student-Score-Prediction)
- **Goal:** Predict student exam scores based on study hours.  
- **Dataset:** Student Performance Factors (Kaggle).  
- **Techniques:** Linear Regression, Data Cleaning, Visualization.  
- **Outcome:** Built a regression model, visualized predictions, and evaluated with RMSE.  

### 2. [Walmart Sales Forecasting](./Walmart-Sales-Forecasting)
- **Goal:** Cluster customers by income & spending score.  
- **Dataset:** Mall Customer (Kaggle).  
- **Techniques:** K-Means Clustering, Scaling, Elbow Method.  
- **Outcome:** Identified customer segments and visualized clusters in 2D plots. 

### 3. [Forest Cover Classification](./Forest-Cover-Classification)
- **Goal:** Predict forest cover type from environmental features.  
- **Dataset:** Covertype (UCI).  
- **Techniques:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- **Outcome:** Achieved strong accuracy; analyzed feature importance and confusion matrix.  

### 4. [Loan Approval Prediction](./Loan-Approval-Prediction)
- **Goal:** Predict whether a loan should be approved.  
- **Dataset:** Loan Approval Prediction (Kaggle).  
- **Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Handling Imbalanced Data.  
- **Outcome:** Improved classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).  

### 5. [Movie Recommendation System](./Movie-Recommendation-System)
- **Goal:** Recommend movies to users based on similarity.  
- **Dataset:** MovieLens 100K (Kaggle).  
- **Techniques:** User-Item Matrix, Similarity Scores, Collaborative Filtering.  
- **Outcome:** Generated personalized recommendations; evaluated with Precision@K.
